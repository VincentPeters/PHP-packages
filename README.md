 Carbon| A simple API extension for DateTime with PHP 5.3+ | [Github](https://github.com/filp/whoops) / [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/nesbot/carbon) 
 Underscore PHP | It features a good hundred of methods for all kinds of types : strings, objects, arrays, functions, integers, etc., and provides a parsing class that help switching from one type to the other mid-course. Oh also it's growing all the time. The cherry on top ? It wraps nicely around native PHP functions meaning String::replace is actually a dynamic call to str_replace but with the benefit of allowed chaining and a finally consistant argument order (all functions in Underscore put the subject as the first argument, NO MATTER WHAT).| [Github](https://packagist.org/packages/anahkiasen/underscore-php) / [Packagist](https://github.com/Anahkiasen/underscore-php) / [Docs](http://anahkiasen.github.io/underscore-php/)
